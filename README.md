# VivaHeart.AI


## Overview

This repository contains the development and implementation details of VIVAHEART.AI, an AI-driven platform designed to provide early detection of heart disease in female smokers. Women who smoke are at higher risk for coronary artery disease, but current diagnostic tools often miss early indicators. VivaHeart.AI aims to bridge this gap by using advanced AI technologies to analyze cardiac CT scans, identify early signs of disease, and provide personalized health insights.

## Key Features

1. **AI-Powered Early Detection**: Detect early signs of coronary inflammation and blockages using advanced Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on cardiac CT scans.
2. **Personalized Risk Assessment**: Leverages patient data (smoking history, cholesterol, etc.) to calculate a customized heart disease risk score.
3. **Comparative Analysis**: Visual comparison of smoker and non-smoker heart scans to highlight the health impacts of smoking.
4. **Predictive Health Alerts**: Sends real-time notifications when heart disease risks spike based on data from wearables.
5. **Healthcare Integration**: Supports Electronic Health Record (EHR) system integration to assist healthcare professionals in diagnostic decision-making.

## Target Audience

- **Primary Audience**: Female smokers aged 20-60, who are at higher risk of heart disease.
- **Secondary Audience**: Healthcare providers (cardiologists) who treat high-risk patients and want to leverage AI for early detection and precision medicine.

## Services Provided

- Early-stage heart disease detection for high-risk patients using AI-powered cardiac CT scan analysis.
- Personalized lifestyle and health recommendations for risk reduction.
- Real-time health tracking and predictive alerts based on wearable device data.
- Seamless integration with healthcare systems for better patient care.

## Performance and Metrics

### Success Metrics

1. **Early Detection Rate**: The percentage of users who receive early detection for heart disease.
2. **User Engagement**: Daily Active Users (DAU) and time spent interacting with the app.
3. **Health Outcome Improvement**: Smoking cessation rates, improvements in cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.
4. **AI Accuracy**: 
   - Precision: Target >90% in correctly identifying heart disease risks.
   - Recall: Target >90% in identifying all potential heart disease cases.
5. **User Retention**: 30-day retention rate to measure ongoing user engagement.

### AI-Specific Metrics

- **False Positive/Negative Rates**: Minimizing misdiagnoses with a target of less than 5% false negatives.
- **Explainability**: Percentage of predictions accompanied by clear visual explanations for healthcare providers.

## Ethical Considerations

VivaHeart.AI is committed to ethical AI usage, particularly in healthcare, where lives are at stake. Ethical considerations include:

- **Data Privacy and Security**: Compliance with HIPAA and GDPR to ensure user data is encrypted and protected.
- **Bias in AI Models**: Regular audits to ensure that the model performs equally well across different demographics, minimizing bias related to gender, age, or ethnicity.
- **Explainability of AI Models**: Ensure that healthcare professionals understand the rationale behind AI predictions through visual heatmaps and detailed explanations.
- **Patient Consent**: Users are fully informed about how their data will be used, and they maintain control over it at all times.
- **Transparency in AI Decisions**: We provide clear, interpretable AI predictions, enabling healthcare professionals and patients to trust the results.
